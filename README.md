Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard (2025)

Developed a cloud-native, interactive whiteboard enabling seamless real-time collaboration for teams. Built with React for a responsive frontend and Node.js + WebSockets for live multi-user editing (e.g., drawing, text, shapes), with sub-50ms latency. Orchestrated using Kubernetes for auto-scaling during peak loads and deployed as Docker containers for portability. Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and ArgoCD for GitOps-driven rollouts, ensuring zero-downtime updates.

```bash
Key Features:
✔ Live Multi-User Editing: Instant sync via WebSockets, with conflict resolution.
✔ Cloud-Native Scalability: Kubernetes-managed pods handle 10k+ concurrent users.
✔ DevOps Automation: End-to-end CI/CD with automated testing, Docker builds, and ArgoCD deployments.
✔ Persistent Boards: Optional MongoDB integration for saving/loading sessions.
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
